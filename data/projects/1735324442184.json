Short answer is that better navigation stack would save Testlio money. This is how - almost all part of Testlio network is based on Freelance Coordinators and Freelance Testers. These log their hours up to a minute daily and get paid accordngly. So if we knew that current navigation is slowing our users down, by our humble internal calculations we figured that even slight decrease in time that users loose on navigation would save Testlio a lot of money.</p>"
